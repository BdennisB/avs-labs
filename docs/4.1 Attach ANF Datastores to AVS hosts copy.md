# Introduction

Azure NetApp Files is an enterprise-class, high-performance, metered file storage service. The service supports the most demanding enterprise file-workloads in the cloud: databases, SAP, and high-performance computing applications, with no code changes. For more information on Azure NetApp Files, see Azure NetApp Files documentation.

Azure VMware Solution supports attaching Network File System (NFS) datastores as a persistent storage option. You can create NFS datastores with Azure NetApp Files volumes and attach them to clusters of your choice. You can also create virtual machines (VMs) for optimal cost and performance.

By using NFS datastores backed by Azure NetApp Files, you can expand your storage instead of scaling the clusters. 

Create your Azure VMware Solution and create Azure NetApp Files NFS volumes in the virtual network connected to it using an ExpressRoute. Ensure there's connectivity from the private cloud to the NFS volumes created. Use those volumes to create NFS datastores and attach the datastores to clusters of your choice in a private cloud. As a native integration, no other permissions configured via vSphere are needed.

The following diagram demonstrates a typical architecture of Azure NetApp Files backed NFS datastores attached to an Azure VMware Solution private cloud via ExpressRoute.

## Overview of steps that need to be done

### Azure networking 
* Create a VNET containing a gateway subnet and a delegated subnet in the same region as where your private cloud sits
* Use Azure VNET connect facility in the connectivity blade of the private cloud to create a gateway and connect it into it
 
 (Deployment for this is roughly 15 minutes)

* Change the ExR GW SKU from standard to Ultra

 (Deployment for this is roughly 35 minutes)

 * Enable fastpath for the private cloud connection into that ExR GW

 (deployment is roughly 2 minutes

### Azure Netapp Files
* Create a Netapp Account
 
 
* Add a capacitypool 
* Add a volume to the capacity pool
* in the storage blade of the private cloud NFS mount the volume as a datastore
